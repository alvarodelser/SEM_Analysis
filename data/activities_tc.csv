Tiene los códigos visuales de los mapas de metro, como un guiño a uno de los modos de transporte significativos de las grandes urbes.

La iniciativa consiste en la creación de un mapa esquemático que representa las principales centralidades de cada ciudad (servicios, plazas, parques, centros de barrio…) y la distancia entre ellas, expresada en metros y en minutos.

Su finalidad es desdramatizar la cultura del caminar, poniendo en evidencia la proximidad entre lugares reconocibles de la ciudad. Al tratarse de distancias cortas y tiempos breves, nos predisponemos mejor a caminar hasta nuestro destino, eligiendo el medio pedestre para nuestros desplazamientos.

Con este proyecto se pretende además resaltar la importancia de ir construyendo ciudades compactas, densas y diversificadas, donde las necesidades de la vida cotidiana pueden resolverse en trayectos de diez o quince minutos a pie, lo que nos permite hacer realidad la famosa teoría de la “ciudad del cuarto de hora”, que sería la distancia a la que tenemos los principales destinos o paradas de transporte público que necesitamos para nuestra vida cotidiana.","{'sequence': 'This is an event called \'Promoting active mobility: Barakaldo Minute Metro\', part of a broader effort during Mobility Week to promote sustainable mobility by local governments.
